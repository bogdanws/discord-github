# Discord-GitHub Integration Bot

A powerful Discord bot that bridges the gap between your Discord server and your GitHub repositories. Get real-time commit notifications and manage your repositories directly from Discord.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Commit Notifications**: Receive detailed, color-coded embed messages for every commit pushed to your repositories.
- **Interactive Revert System**: Admins can quickly revert commits using interactive buttons and confirmation modals.
- **Repository-to-Channel Assignment**: Assign different repositories to specific channels for organized notifications.
- **Permission Control**: Fine-grained control over who can use administrative commands using Discord's role and permission system.

## ðŸ¤– Commands

- `/ping`: Checks the bot's latency and responsiveness.
- `/help`: Displays a list of available commands.
- `/status`: Shows the current status and configuration of the bot.
- `/revert`: (Admin-only) Reverts a specific commit by its hash.
